# Traffic Accident Analysis - USA 2016-2019
### Author - Akanksha Shetty
I'm from India which has the second-largest population in the world. Mumbai specifically is known to be the city that never sleeps. Coming to the States was a huge difference for me especially because of how less crowded this place was. Back in Mumbai, I used to live in a locality called Andheri, which has one of the busiest streets. Traffic accidents were a normal thing, in fact, sometimes it gets so bad that the cops have to step in and make the public follow them overriding the traffic signals. I don't think I have experienced anything like this here especially because of this place being not-so-crowded or at least the city I live in here. However, this made me curious about the number of traffic accidents occurring across all states in the United States of America. 


For this project, I plan on analyzing the traffic accidents occurring in the USA and the factors influencing it.

The primary dataset I chose for my project can be found here 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
    
and this is the data for traffic accidents in the USA for the years 2016-2019. 
   

The secondary data set I chose to take can be found here https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/popest-nation.html, this consists of charts of top 10 populated states in the year 2019 and percentage growth. From this dataset I wanted to obtain the actual population of the states in 2019. The dataset values can also be verified with Wikipedia as they are accurate.
